        <h1>Simple man</h1>
        <p>by Lynydr Skynyrd</p>
        <p>Mama told me when I was young Come sit beside me, my only son And listen closely to what I say And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day, oh yeah</p>
        <p>Oh, take your time. Don't live too fast Troubles will come and they will pass Go find a woman and you'll find love And don't forget son, there is someone up above</p>
        <p>And be a simple kind of man Oh be something, you love and understand Baby be a simple kind of man Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can?</p>
        <p>Forget your lust, for the rich man's gold All that you need, is in your soul And you can do this, oh baby, if you try All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied</p>
